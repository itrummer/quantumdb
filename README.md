# Multiple Query Optimization on the D-Wave Quantum Annealer

This repository contains code from the VLDB'16 paper "Multiple query optimization on the D-Wave 2X adiabatic quantum computer". The code maps instances of the multiple query optimization problem into a formalism that can be understood by the D-Wave quantum annealer.
